## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Hybrid Travel Assistant for Vietnam**, combining **Graph-based reasoning (Neo4j)** and **Semantic Vector Search (Pinecone)**, orchestrated via **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.  
The assistant understands user queries, routes them intelligently to the right subsystem (vector, graph, or both), and synthesizes a final, contextually-rich response using an LLM.

---

## ⚙️ Key Improvements Made

### 🧩 1. Modular Node Architecture
- Separated all core logic into modular node files under `GraphNodes/`:
  - `router_node.py` – routes queries using an LLM + structured output.
  - `pinecone_node.py` – performs semantic search with local embeddings + Pinecone.
  - `cypher_node.py` – translates questions into Cypher and queries Neo4j.
  - `answer_node.py` – synthesizes final response from retrieved contexts.
- Each node logs independently to its own log file under `/logs`.

---

### 🚦 2. Intelligent Routing (Router Node)
- Introduced **`RouterDecision`** Pydantic schema for structured LLM output.
- Built a dedicated routing prompt that classifies user queries as:
  - `pinecone` → for descriptive or recommendation queries.
  - `cypher` → for factual queries requiring graph data.
  - `both` → for hybrid (mixed factual + descriptive) queries.
  - `none` → for greetings or off-topic input.
- Ensured consistent state updates via `AgentState`.

---

### 🧭 3. Hybrid Orchestration via LangGraph
- Built a **LangGraph workflow** with conditional routing and parallel execution.
- The conditional edge uses `conditional_router()` to branch based on router output.
- The `"both"` route now triggers parallel execution of vector and graph search before joining into the synthesis node.
- Added proper end-to-end execution flow:

---

### 🧮 4. Robust Graph + Vector Layers
- ✅ **Neo4j Integration:**
- Used `GraphCypherQAChain` with a custom `ChatPromptTemplate`.
- Enforced strict schema rules (e.g., use `:City`, `:Hotel`, etc., not `:Entity`).
- Added automatic schema validation and connection testing.

- ✅ **Pinecone Integration:**
- Local embeddings via `SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)`.
- Added auto-index creation logic (using `ServerlessSpec`).
- Supports JSON-formatted context aggregation.

---

### 💬 5. Answer Synthesis
- Created a **unified synthesis prompt** that:
- Merges `vector_context` and `graph_context` seamlessly.
- Provides human-like, well-structured responses.
- Avoids mentioning data source names explicitly.
- Implemented graceful fallback responses when no context is found.

---

### 🧠 6. Utility Enhancements
- Introduced a centralized `utils.py`:
- Contains `get_llm()` for consistent LLM instantiation.
- Easy switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLMs in future.
- Added `config.py` for clean environment management.
- Implemented **logging setup with auto-directory creation** to avoid runtime errors.

---

### ⚡ 7. Async & Performance Improvements
- Prepared code for future **async** adaptation.
- Lightweight chain invocation ensures smooth execution.
- Decided to skip cache layer for now (as context uploads are not repetitive).

---

### 🧩 8. Reliability & Debuggability
- Introduced structured logging per node:
- `logs/vector_search_node.log`
- `logs/graph_cypher_node.log`
- `logs/router_node.log`
- `logs/answer_node.log`
- Added meaningful print statements to trace node execution and data flow.

---

### 🧭 9. End-to-End Execution
- Added a **CLI interface** (`hybrid_chat.py`) for easy testing:
- Supports continuous conversation.
- Gracefully handles “exit” or “quit”.
- Displays LLM decisions and synthesized results.

---

## 🚀 Next Possible Improvements
- [ ] Convert all search + synthesis nodes to fully **async** functions.
- [ ] Add **caching** for repeated vector queries (using local SQLite or Redis).
- [ ] Integrate **tool usage visualization** in LangGraph UI.
- [ ] Add **evaluation notebook** to test routing accuracy and latency.
- [ ] Dockerize setup with all dependencies preloaded.
